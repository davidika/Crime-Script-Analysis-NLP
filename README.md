### Abstract

In recent years, internet connectivity and the ubiquitous use of digital devices have afforded a landscape of expanding opportunity for offenders. Scams, here defined as schemes designed to deceive individuals into giving away money or personal information generally through the use of the Internet or some other communication medium such as a phone call or text message, are commonplace globally. Their impacts on victims have been shown to encompass social, psychological, emotional and economic harms. Consequently, there is a strong rationale to enhance our understanding of scams in order to devise ways in which they can be disrupted. 

Crime scripting is an analytical approach which seeks to characterise the processes which underpin crime events in sufficient detail to aid in the identification of potential points of intervention where crimes might be prevented. Crime scripting typically involves the analysis of large quantities of data describing crime events from which such key processes are drawn. While this approach has been shown to be effective in systematically understanding a diverse range of offences, it is highly resource intensive and as a result not particularly commonplace. 

In this paper, we explore how Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods might be applied to extract insights from unstructured textual data with the aim of supporting crime script analyses. To illustrate this approach, we apply NLP to a public dataset of victimsâ€™ stories of scams perpetrated in Singapore. Applying a range of methods, we demonstrate approaches capable of automatically isolating scams with similar modus operandi, extracting key elements from their descriptions, and work towards identifying the temporal ordering of these elements in ways that characterise how a particular scam operates. Our exploratory results provide a further example of how NLP methods may in the future enable crime preventers to better harness unstructured free text data to better understand crime problems and in turn devise strategies that seek to reduce them.
